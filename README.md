Insiders Clustering



Problem:

The marketing team will launch a loyalty program for the best customers in the base, called Insiders. But the team does not have an advanced knowledge in data analysis to elect the participants of the program.

Deliverables:

As a result for this project, we are expected to deliver a list of people eligible to participate in the Insiders program, along with a report answering the following questions:

Who are the people eligible to participate in the Insider program?
How many customers will be part of the group?
What are the main characteristics of these customers?
What is the percentage of revenue contribution from Insiders?
What is the expectation of this group's revenue for the coming months?
What are the conditions for a person to be eligible for Insiders?
What are the conditions for a person to be removed from Insiders?
What is the guarantee that the Insiders program is better than the rest of the base?
What actions can the marketing team take to increase sales?
